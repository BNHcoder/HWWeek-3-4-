		Four Pillars of OOP
		1. Abstraction
				3 lines
				3 angles that add to 180
				
		2. Encapsulation
			hiding inner works of code
			Driving a car driver use gas breaks, but the pistons do all the work under the hood
		
		4. Inheritance
			objects can be inherited just like from a parent
		
		5. Polymormorphism
			Animal communication
			Dog barks, cat meows, bear roar
			can take a different form or shape
			
		class is a blueprint
		
		object is product developed from blueprint is an instance of a class
			
			
			
			user uses public features
		3. Inheritance
